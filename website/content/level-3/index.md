## <i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Process 流程

### Process Overview 流程概述

You will implement standardization across the organization with the benefit of improving onboarding and expanding your cloud native footprint and awareness. You will create a feedback loop. You will invest in repeatability. Do you have the tools in place that are accessible to everyone? Do you have Git services? Have you implemented workspace collaboration to save time, labor or avoid duplication? Finally, what is your process for measuring resource usage? In level three, you should be measuring your container usage, CPU and memory (runtime and uptime). Automation and processes associated with software release will also be extended to platforms. Lifecycle operations such as upgrades and patching, particularly CVEs and critical updates will benefit from further automation and the introduction of Infrastructure-as-code technologies.
您将在整个组织中实施标准化，以改善入职流程，扩大您的云原生印记和认知度。您将创建一个反馈循环。您将投资于可重复性。您是否已经为所有人提供了可访问的工具？您是否有 Git 服务？您是否实施了工作空间协作以节省时间、劳动力或避免重复？最后，您的资源使用量测量过程是什么？在第三级，您应该测量容器使用量、CPU 和内存（运行时间和正常运行时间）。与软件发布相关的自动化和流程也将扩展到平台。生命周期操作（例如升级和修补程序，特别是 CVE 和关键更新）将受益于进一步的自动化和基础架构即代码技术的引入。

### CI/CD

You are implementing a center of excellence around your CI/CD process.
您正在围绕您的 CI/CD 流程实施卓越中心。

### Change Control 变更控制

Your code quality is improving as measured with automated tooling and you are seeing CI and test success frequently.
您的代码质量正在提高，使用自动化工具进行衡量，您经常看到 CI 和测试成功。

### Security 安全

Implement automatic continuous scanning to flag misconfigurations or security issues.
实施自动连续扫描，以标记配置错误或安全问题。

### Audit and Logs 审计和日志

Start to audit and implement initial alerts. Filter noise.
开始审计并实施初始警报。过滤噪音。

## <i class="fas fa-edit"></i> Policy 策略

### Policy Overview 策略概述

You will implement policy-as-code and build this into your CI pipeline.
您将实施策略即代码，并将其构建到您的 CI 流水线中。

### Policy Creation 策略创建

Create policies based on metrics refined around security, efficiency and reliability.
根据围绕安全性、效率和可靠性精细化的度量创建策略。

### Compliance 合规性

Policy compliance and auditing carried out through automated means on Kubernetes. This will likely include initial development of policy-as-code.
在 Kubernetes 上通过自动化手段进行策略合规性和审计。这可能包括策略即代码的初始开发。

## <i class="fas fa-server"></i> Technology 技术

### Technology Overview 技术概述

Here you start to scale. Your suite of tools is more standardized. You're getting your release tooling, secrets management and policy tooling in place. You’re also starting to get a level of buy-in across your organization, which is helping to propel you forward. This is where you will be running the largest number of tools as you will be in the thick of evaluating, implementing, and running in production.
在这里，您开始扩展规模。您的工具套件更加标准化。您正在安装发布工具、密钥管理和策略工具。您还开始在整个组织中获得一定程度的认可，这有助于推动您前进。这是您将运行最多工具的地方，因为您将处于评估、实施和生产运行的繁忙阶段。

### Infrastructure 基础架构

As part of building confidence in your cloud infrastructure, you need to gain visibility into what your infrastructure is doing. Developing your monitoring, alerting and resource usage capabilities is going to be your focus. An important consideration here is that where previously you may have considered machine-specific properties such as CPU, RAM etc, you’ll also want to factor in cluster resource metrics also. Additionally, you’ll replace components when they fail rather than spending time remediating issues in production. This builds on Level 2. Furthermore, you may also look to manage infrastructure with Kubernetes like you would software.
基于建立对云基础架构的信心，你需要获得对基础架构正在执行的操作的可见性。你的重点将是发展监控、警报和资源使用能力。一个重要的考虑因素是，在以前，你可能考虑了与机器特定属性相关的指标，如 CPU、RAM 等，但现在你也需要考虑集群资源指标。此外，你将在组件发生故障时进行替换，而不是在生产环境中花费时间修复问题。这是建立在 Level 2 基础上的。此外，你还可以像管理软件一样，使用 Kubernetes 管理基础架构。

### Container and Runtime Management 容器和运行时管理

Whereas in Level 2 you’ve been experimenting, in Level 3, as you increase your workload, and as you scale, you need consistent tooling across clusters to gain continuous visibility into your Kubernetes clusters. This should include automatic scanning and having runtime observability of what is occurring within your containers and your cluster. CNCF projects are good options here. You will have alerting and dashboards in place.
在第二级阶段中，您一直在进行试验，但在第三级阶段，随着工作量的增加和规模的扩大，您需要跨集群使用一致的工具，以持续了解您的 Kubernetes 集群。这应该包括自动扫描，并且具有运行时可观察性，了解容器和集群中发生的情况。CNCF 项目是很好的选择。您将建立警报和仪表板。

### Application Patterns and Refactoring 应用程序模式和重构

Culturally, your organization has started to think about services rather than “servers”. Microservices are embraced within the organization and are now used by default where appropriate.
从文化上讲，你的组织开始思考服务而不是“服务器”。微服务在组织中得到认可，并在适当的情况下成为默认选项。

### Application Release and Operations 应用发布和运维

Because consistency is important, you may be starting to write Helm Charts for your application releases. You may also be starting to take your first steps into GitOps with Flux and Argo, introducing controllers to manage your release and operations.
由于一致性非常重要，您可能会开始为应用程序发布编写Helm Charts。您可能还会开始尝试使用Flux和Argo进行GitOps，并引入控制器来管理您的发布和运维操作。

### Security and Policy 安全和策略

It’s now time to step up and automate your deployment guardrails and security best practices with policy as code. Determine your strategy for enforcement. Begin adopting third party benchmarks and standards where relevant. Consider also adopting anomaly and threat detection technologies.
现在是时候采取行动，通过代码制定策略来自动化您的部署防护和安全最佳实践。确定您的执行策略。开始采用第三方基准和标准（适用的情况下）。还要考虑采用异常和威胁检测技术。

### Testing and Issue Detection 测试和问题检测

On the basis of your experiments in the previous level, you’ll be implementing this in production, and including good alerting and good dashboards, building out your observability capabilities.
根据您在前一个级别的实验，您将在生产环境中实施此操作，并包括良好的警报和良好的仪表板，构建您的可观察性能力。

## <i class="fas fa-building"></i> Business Outcomes 业务成果

In Level 3, your competency is growing and you are scaling. Up to this point, your teams have been focusing on learning cloud native. In this stage, your business outcomes are dependent on your team’s experience. As the team builds confidence, their competency around security, efficiency and reliability grows and they will implement defined processes for scale. All of these will impact your services and applications as the team improves. Your business should start to notice operations are more scalable and if not you will need to improve lines of communication to demonstrate this scale, or review the actual scaling results, so they can be optimized further.
在第三级，您的能力正在增长并且正在扩展。到目前为止，您的团队一直在专注于学习云原生。在这个阶段，您的业务成果取决于团队的经验。随着团队建立信心，他们在安全性、效率和可靠性方面的能力将增长，并将实施适用于扩展的定义流程。所有这些都将影响团队改进服务和应用程序。您的业务应该开始注意到操作的可扩展性，如果没有，您需要改善沟通渠道以展示这种可扩展性，或者审查实际的扩展结果，以便进一步优化。

You will have safeguarded your application or service from a single point of failure or disappointing performance in Level 3.

Monitoring is implemented. This will help the business get reports on what’s working and what isn't working. While the monitoring may be very specific, it will also provide insights into resource utilization to control costs and performance to ensure availability.
在第三级，您将保护您的应用程序或服务免受单点故障或性能不佳的影响。

已实施监控。这将帮助企业获得有关工作情况和问题的报告。虽然监控可能非常具体，但它也将提供资源利用率的见解，以控制成本和确保可用性。

Finally, you should be observing the flexibility and scalability of cloud native by comparing old vs. new:

- Deploying a server takes minutes with Infrastructure as Code instead of days. Business translation: faster time to market.
- Monitoring for security attacks. Business translation: less risk, stolen data.
- Observability: Logging, metrics and tracing. Business translation: quicker responsiveness to changes in application behavior or business demand. Better customer experience and reduction in lost sales due to service degradation.
- Improved Reusability: containers and microservices make it easier to reuse components already available from previous projects. Business translation: 1. guarantee of brand image consistency and standardized functionalities throughout the multiple apps; 2. a lower learning curve for customers using those apps.

最后，您应该通过比较新旧技术来观察云原生的灵活性和可扩展性：

- 采用基础架构即代码，部署服务器只需几分钟而不是几天。业务转化：更快的上市时间。
- 监控安全攻击。业务转化：降低风险，避免数据被盗。
- 可观察性：日志记录、指标和跟踪。业务转化：更快地响应应用行为或业务需求的变化。更好的客户体验，减少由于服务退化而导致的销售损失。
- 改进的可重用性：容器和微服务使得更容易重用之前项目中已有的组件。业务转化：1.保证品牌形象的一致性和多个应用程序中的标准功能；2.减少客户使用这些应用程序的学习曲线。
