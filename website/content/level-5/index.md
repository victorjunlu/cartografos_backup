实现成熟度确保您可以向组织展示CI/CD流程的好处。您将能够清楚地看到速度增加、持续部署速度的提高以及对业务的影响。例如，您将更快地推出新功能。

### Change Control 变更控制
You now have quality engineering (QE) capability. That means you have quality guardrails in place, continuous deployment to production with only a failed automated test preventing an update being automatically released to production. You are seeing fewer defects, hotfixes and bug fixes being released. You now have best practices in place and have removed human access from production in favor of service accounts. You are also using monitoring failures to restart or manage problematic and failing resources.
现在，您拥有质量工程（QE）能力。这意味着您已经建立了质量保障措施，并实现了对生产环境的持续部署，只有自动化测试失败才会阻止更新自动发布到生产环境。您发现发布的缺陷、热修复和错误修复越来越少。现在，您已经建立了最佳实践，并采用了服务账户取代了人员对生产环境的访问。您还使用监控故障来重新启动或管理问题和失败的资源。

### Security 安全
The software supply chain is secured, with reproducible builds and software bills of materials providing insight into code and dependencies, with clear code provenance and secured release pipelines.You've shifted security left. You are preserving security by continuously monitoring Kubernetes for security and vulnerabilities.
软件供应链已经得到保障，具备可重复构建和软件材料清单的功能，可提供代码和依赖关系的洞察力，具备明确的代码来源和安全的发布流程。您已经将安全工作前移。通过持续监测 Kubernetes 的安全性和漏洞来维护安全。

### Audit and Logs  审计和日志
You are enforcing audits.
您正在执行强制审计。

## <i class="fas fa-edit"></i> Policy 策略

### Policy Overview 策略概述

Based on your learnings, you will refine your policies as your organization achieves maturity, taking advantage of technologies such as machine learning in order to improve detection and enforcement.
基于您的学习，随着组织成熟度的提高，您将完善策略，并利用诸如机器学习等技术来改进检测和执行。

### Policy Creation 策略创建

Contribute policies to the open source community and active engagement with regulators and other external stakeholders.
向开源社区贡献策略，并积极参与监管机构和其他外部利益相关者的互动。

### Compliance 合规性

Compliance never ends! You will tighten the feedback loop with stakeholders and take advantage of advanced machine learning and other tooling to understand what is normal for your environment and ensure visibility of anomalous conditions in a large volume of compliance data.
合规永无止境！您将加强与利益相关者的反馈循环，并利用先进的机器学习和其他工具来了解您的环境的正常情况，并确保在大量合规性数据中看到异常情况的可见性。
