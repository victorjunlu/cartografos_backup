## <i class="fas fa-users"></i> People 人员

### People Overview 人员概述

As you improve, you are shifting competency to the development team for them to self-service. Full commitment from leadership.
随着您的改进，您正在将能力转移给开发团队，让他们自助。领导层全力支持。

### Organizational Change 组织变革

Cloud is now the default infrastructure for all services. The business is now requesting services from DevSecOps vs. requesting traditional servers.
云已成为所有服务的默认基础架构。现在业务请求的是从DevSecOps获取服务，而不是请求传统的服务器。

### Teams and Decentralization 团队和分权化

As the platform becomes more established, you can really start the process of decentralization. You can work on the development of a self-service portal incorporating the policies and processes of your organization to enable developer service ownership.
随着平台的日趋成熟，您可以真正开始分权化的过程。您可以致力于开发一个自助门户，将您组织的策略和流程融入其中，以便开发人员能够拥有服务所有权。

### Security 安全性

By this level, security is involved in design and deployment, you will enforce security in your cloud native environment. Your organization is committed to security with full understanding of policies and regulations both inside and outside of the organization.
到了这个层面，安全性已经涉及到设计和部署，您将在云原生环境中强制执行安全性。您的组织致力于安全，对组织内外的政策和法规有全面的理解。

### Developer Agility 开发者敏捷性

Feedback is extended from application metrics through to platform and non-functional requirements with clear mapping of value streams to technological implementation. Developers are able to quickly test complex scenarios with many unknowns, cloud and application risks are easily and quickly identified and patched.
反馈从应用程序指标延伸到平台和非功能需求，同时将价值流映射到技术实现上。开发人员能够快速测试具有许多未知因素的复杂情况，云和应用程序风险很容易且快速地被识别和修复。

### Upskilling Developers  提升开发者技能

Developers are more sophisticated and Kubernetes is widely adopted by multiple groups in different business areas, with a body of knowledge developing and actively shared including integration and release processes. Developers and cluster owners are actively expanding Kubernetes in line with their specific business and technical needs.
开发者更加精通，Kubernetes被多个不同业务领域的多个团队广泛采用，正在发展并积极分享一套包括集成和发布流程的知识体系。开发人员和集群所有者正在积极根据其特定的业务和技术需求扩展Kubernetes。


### CNCF Certifications CNCF 认证

## <i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Process 流程

### Process Overview 流程概述

The governance model in place will support DevSecOps. You have guardrails in place to support agile software development. You will establish an application services library. You will also set policy around container usage for example auto-scaling policies or HPC.
现有的治理模型将支持 DevSecOps。您已经设置了防护栏，以支持敏捷软件开发。您将建立一个应用程序服务库。您还将制定关于容器使用的策略，例如自动缩放策略或 HPC。

### CI/CD

You will measure your release velocity and cadence to make improvements.
您将测量发布速度和节奏，以进行改进。

### Change Control 变更控制

You have continuous delivery, but no continuous deployment to production - you still have a gate to production that requires operator approval.
您已经实现了持续交付，但是没有持续部署到生产环境 - 您仍然需要一个进入生产环境的门，需要操作员批准。

### Security 安全性

Ensure security remediation is automated and/or identified automatically with remediation advice.
确保安全修复是自动化的和/或可以自动识别，并提供修复建议。

### Audit and Logs 审计和日志

Audit and alerts become mainstream and are made mandatory across applications.
审计和警报已经变得主流，并且已经成为各种应用程序的强制要求。

## <i class="fas fa-edit"></i> Policy

### Policy Overview 策略概述

You now have defined SLAs around policies and remediation.
您现在已经定义了关于策略和修复的服务级别协议（SLA）。

### Policy Creation 策略创建

Customize policies based on your business needs and minimize exceptions.
根据您的业务需求定制策略，并尽量减少例外情况。

### Compliance 合规性

Expansion of policy tooling to include applications such as traffic proxies, service mesh, message buses and Linux. This will broaden the scope of managed policies, but it will also help in having them under control by way of declarative configurations.
扩展策略工具，包括流量代理、服务网格、消息总线和 Linux 等应用程序。这将扩大受管策略的范围，但也将有助于通过声明性配置将其控制在管理之下。

## <i class="fas fa-server"></i> Technology 技术

### Technology Overview 技术概述

You’ve got full control over your environment, and you’ve built your confidence, with rapid adoption of cloud native patterns for new applications and platforms. You’ve also gained organizational commitment to cloud native and this is adding to your momenting. You’re starting to feel like you’ve “crossed the chasm.”
您对环境拥有完全控制，并且通过快速采用云原生模式为新应用程序和平台建立了信心。您还获得了组织对云原生的承诺，这正在增加您的动力。您开始感觉自己已经“跨越了鸿沟”。

### Infrastructure 基础设施

Kubernetes and its API has become extremely familiar to you. With your infrastructure and IaC tooling, you’ll likely find yourself investigating ClusterAPI and using that for deploying and managing the lifecycle of your clusters. As you also look to further refine control of your platforms, you’ll work to implement policy for your infrastructure control plane and other infrastructure controllers.
Kubernetes及其API已经对您来说非常熟悉。通过基础架构和IaC工具，您可能会发现自己正在调查ClusterAPI并将其用于部署和管理集群的生命周期。同时，您也会进一步完善平台控制，实施基础设施控制平面和其他基础设施控制器的策略。

### Container and Runtime Management 容器和运行时管理

With your sources of information you've gained from Level 3, your goal is to further integrate your data sources and gain visibility along with alerting. This closes the feedback loop on runtime and operations and allows you to respond quickly to unplanned events.
在第三级获得的信息来源的基础上，您的目标是进一步整合数据源，增加可见性和报警功能。这样可以在运行时和操作上关闭反馈循环，使您能够快速响应未计划的事件。

### Application Patterns and Refactoring 应用程序模式和重构

Microservices have become the preferred pattern for applications. The use of APIs is expanding within the organization, and other internal systems may be exposed and consumed, and they are available for general consumption, open across the organization via a service mesh. The organization becomes data-centric and API-centric, and data can be more easily consumed.
微服务已成为应用程序的首选模式。 API 的使用在组织内扩展，其他内部系统可能会被公开和消费，并且它们可以通过服务网格在整个组织中开放使用。组织变得数据中心和 API 中心，并且数据可以更轻松地被消费。

### Application Release and Operations 应用程序发布与运营

Not only are you using GitOps operators for rapid deployment, but you may also be using them for development and test purposes. You’ll be expecting most of your software to be packaged with Helm with the feedback loop being closed as quickly as possible to reduce configuration drift.

你不仅使用GitOps操作员来实现快速部署，还可能将它们用于开发和测试目的。你将期望大部分的软件都是通过Helm打包的，并尽可能快地关闭反馈循环，以减少配置漂移。

### Security and Policy 安全与策略

Apply your policy against production in case you haven’t already. You’ll continue to tune your policies in production.
如果您还没有这样做，请将您的策略应用于生产环境。您将继续在生产环境中调整您的策略。

### Testing and Issue Detection 测试和问题检测

As your environment becomes more complex in production, some issue remediation may require adjusting your policy-as-code or components of your Infrastructure as Code, as well as your application. Issues may relate to more than one application so you will aggregate across applications to determine trends. These may relate to bugs such as memory leaks, as well as security or policy issues. Your remediation may be to fix them at source, ideally as ‘far left’ as possible, or otherwise building automation capable of fixing them when they occur, and tuning it over time.
随着您的生产环境变得更加复杂，一些问题的修复可能需要调整您的策略即代码或基础设施即代码的组件，以及您的应用程序。问题可能涉及多个应用程序，因此您将跨应用程序进行汇总以确定趋势。这些问题可能涉及错误，例如内存泄漏，以及安全或策略问题。您的解决方案可能是在源头修复它们，最好是尽可能“向左”，否则建立能够在出现问题时自动修复并随着时间推移进行调整的自动化。

## <i class="fas fa-building"></i> Business Outcomes 商业成果

Level 4 is focused on improvements around security, policy and governance across your environment. The team can focus more of their time on your business instead of maintaining Kubernetes. Level 4 is also the next level where clients and customers plateau. And most customers can stay at this level as they further mature.
Level 4的重点是改进您的环境中的安全、策略和治理。团队可以将更多时间集中在业务上，而不是维护Kubernetes。Level 4也是客户和用户停滞的下一个级别。大多数客户可以在进一步成熟时保持在这个级别。

Your team has cloud native confidence and now it’s time to take that knowledge and apply it more thoroughly to your business goals.You have continued to measure yourself against established KPIs in Level 1 and provided those to the business. You’ll have alignment on goals because you can demonstrate outcomes. The business should expect to see:

- Established protocols and procedures
- Policy enforcement of compliance standards
- Comparison of cloud native apps vs. non-cloud native
- The business should expect more reporting in this phase. Reporting should cover compliance, security, performance and cost. These should be easily aligned to the business goals established in Level 1.

您的团队拥有云原生信心，现在是将这些知识更彻底地应用于业务目标的时候了。您将继续根据Level 1建立的关键绩效指标对自己进行衡量，并将这些指标提供给业务。因为您可以展示成果，所以您将在目标上保持一致。业务应该期望看到：

- 建立的协议和程序
- 合规标准的策略执行
- 云原生应用与非云原生应用的比较
- 在这个阶段，业务应该期望看到更多的报告。报告应涵盖合规性、安全性、性能和成本。这些应该与在Level 1中建立的业务目标轻松对齐。

At this point, you may start to migrate your other applications and have a better understanding of what you want to achieve and where you will see value during each level of maturity.
此时，您可以开始迁移其他应用程序，并更好地了解您想要实现的目标以及在每个成熟级别中看到的价值。
